# Fixes Issue (Insert Issue Number)

- [ ] Ensure Test Coverage for Bug
- [ ] Is CI Passing?
  - [ ] Github Actions

If a CI is not passing, and if you feel it is a bug elsewhere in the
development process, please let us know in a comment in this section.

## Bugfix Description

Write here what you did to fix the bug and explain why it is the correct
bugfix. A good method would be to list out what each commit does.

## Further Work

Often, even though a bug is fixed, the method for fixing the bug may not be
ideal. In such cases, you might have ideas on the changes that need to be made
in the codebase to improve its quality in context of the bug and/or the bugfix.
We welcome you to write those observations in this section. Some examples of
such work are listed below:

1. Changes in codebase to prevent future bugs.
2. Work needed to fix the bug more comprehensively.
3. Work to find out similar potential bugs in the codebase.
