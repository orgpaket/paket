If a CI is not passing, and if you feel it is a bug elsewhere in the

## Feature Description

List all the functionality that has been added to provide the requested feature
along with reasoning. A good method would be to outline the feature and then
describe what each commit does.

## Further Work

Write here further work that needs to be done. These can include a lot of
different things. Some of the examples are:

1. Changes in codebase to make similar feature requests easier.
2. Work needed to provide the feature in a more holistic manner.
